# nand-computer
HDL has all the hdl files that are made as the part of this project. A seperate folder called large parts has been made as this forces the hardware simulator to use builtin java implementations for some of the parts. While this is ideally to be avoided, the memory and consequentially the computer are very complex parts causing the hardware simulator to struggle in implementing their hdl internal parts. The hdl implementations of all the parts are nevertheless in the hdl files folder and if not for computational limits the computer can be simulated without this workaround.

Open the hardware simulater .bat file to run the hardware simulator (requires jre https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp , also refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW6Z_Xp2v-c )
Testing can be done by using the .tst files in the HDL folder.
